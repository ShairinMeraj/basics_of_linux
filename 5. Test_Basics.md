Essays are commonly used as literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. 
Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays (e.g., Alexander Pope's An Essay on Criticism and An Essay on Man). 
While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of 
Population are counterexamples.In some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal education.[2] Secondary students are taught structured essay 
formats to improve their writing skills; admission essays are often used by universities in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays 
are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.
